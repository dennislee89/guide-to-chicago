			  <div class="textLeft "> <h2>Green Door Tavern</h2>
			   From its earliest days, The Green Door Tavern has been a neighborhood favorite. It’s warm wooden interiors, decorative backsplash of memorabilia from days long past, and down-to-earth staff have kept its many loyal customers happy through Chicago’s bitter winters to its hot, summer nights. In the 1930s, the bar acquired the nickname "The Green Door", and this was eventually adopted formally. George Parenti purchased the bar from the Giacomoni brothers in August 1985.The structure developed a lean from plumb in its early years, due to the construction techniques used at the time, and this is still noticeable.

			  <div class="textRight"> <h2>Al's Italian Beef</h2>
			   The great Chicago sandwich was actually formed out of necessity during the Great Depression when meat was scarce. In order to make the most of what they had, Chris and Al would slice the meat very thin and place it on thick loaves of fresh made Italian bread. The original recipe, which is still used in all Al’s Beef locations today, was developed in Al’s home kitchen. The family sold the delicious sandwiches at a neighborhood food stand and delivered them to local businesses until they opened their current location on West Taylor Street in Chicago.  It was at this storefront where they added other items to the menu, including Italian sausage, Chicago hot dogs, homemade hand-cut French fries and Polish sausages, to name a few.  Taylor Street remains today as one of Chicago's truly iconic food destinations. <p class="priceText">Average price: $10 per person <br><br> <a class="tag" href="#modal9">More info</a>

			   he Uno story begins in Chicago in 1943 when Ike Sewell developed deep dish pizza and opened a new type of restaurant at the corner of Ohio & Wabash. It was here that Ike served a pizza unlike any that had been served before. Buttery 'out-of-this-world' crust that had a tall edge like a fruit pie. He created a recipe that combined authentic Italian spices and quality tomatoes with more cheese than people could believe and then baked it for nearly an hour. When people tasted it, they wanted more of the same and the lines have been forming ever since to get into the restaurant.  <br><br>
